 STL( Standard Template Library). 
 COMPONENTS OF STL:

We have three components in STL:

Containers,
Algorithm &
Iterators

Containers, objects which store data, Algorithms, set of procedures to process data, and Iterators, objects which point to some element in a container. Today, in this tutorial, we will be interested in discussing more about containers.
Containers are themselves of three types: 
1] Sequence Containers:
A sequence container stores that data in a linear fashion. Refer to the illustration below to understand what storing something in a linear fashion means.
Sequence containers include Vector, List, Dequeue etc. These are some of the most used sequence containers.
2]Associative Containers:
An associative container is designed in such a way that enhances the accessing of some element in that container. It is very much used when the user wants to fastly reach some element. Some of these containers are, Set, Multiset, Map, Multimap etc.  They store their data in a tree-like structure.
3]Derived Containers :
 As the name suggests, these containers are derived from either the sequence or the associative containers. They often provide you with some better methods to deal with your data. They deal with real life modelling. Some examples of derived containers are Stack, Queue, Priority Queue, etc. The following illustration give you the idea of how a stack works.
